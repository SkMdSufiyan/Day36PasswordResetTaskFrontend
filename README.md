# Day36PasswordResetTaskFrontend

The password reset can be done using the "Forgot password button" given on the home page or using the "Forgot password?" link given at the bottom of the login page.

For resetting the password, the user should signup first.

For simplicity, the "account activation" process by sending an email link is ignored in this task.

As just password reset flow is asked for this task, and NO authentication is asked, this task is done without authentication.

This site may sometimes take longer time to send an email and respond with a confirmation message such as "reset link is sent to your email id". Therefore, kindly wait till the page responds.
